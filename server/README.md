## Introduction

The `go-web-app` is a simple web server application developed using Go and the Gin framework. It serves as a demonstration of setting up a RESTful API with basic CRUD functionality and other essential web server capabilities.

## Features

- RESTful API with Gin framework
- Basic CRUD operations for managing resources
- Configurable environment settings
- Simple logging and error handling mechanisms
- Built-in testing support

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or later)
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-web-app.git
   cd go-web-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Download and install the necessary Go modules:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Build the Application**

   Compile the application into a binary:

   ```bash
   go build -o server main.go
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the server:

   ```bash
   ./server
   ```

   The server defaults to port `8080`. You can adjust this in the configuration file if needed.

## Usage

With the server running, you can interact with the API using tools such as `curl` or Postman. Here are example commands for common operations:

- **GET** `/api/endpoint`
  
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint
  ```

- **POST** `/api/endpoint`
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint -d '{"key":"value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```

- **PUT** `/api/endpoint/{id}`
  
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint/1 -d '{"key":"newvalue"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```

- **DELETE** `/api/endpoint/{id}`
  
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/endpoint/1
  ```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/endpoint` - Retrieve a list of items.
- `POST /api/endpoint` - Create a new item.
- `PUT /api/endpoint/{id}` - Update an existing item by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/endpoint/{id}` - Delete an item by its ID.

## Configuration

Configuration can be managed via environment variables or a configuration file.

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Port on which the server listens (default: `8080`).
- `DATABASE_URL` - Connection URL for the database (if applicable).

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to define these variables:

```
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

### Configuration File

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file to set application-specific settings. Refer to the [configuration documentation](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## Testing

To run tests for the application, use:

```bash
go test ./...
```

For verbose test output:

```bash
go test -v
```

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push your branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Submit a Pull Request.

Please ensure that your code adheres to the project's style guidelines and includes tests for new features.
